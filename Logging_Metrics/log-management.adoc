= Logging and Metrics

== Goal

Send logs for an application to Papertrail using syslog draining.

Estimated time: 15 minutes

== Configure Syslog Draining for an Application

. Sign up for a free Papertrail account: https://papertrailapp.com/.

. Follow the instructions on link:http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/services/log-management-thirdparty-svc.html#papertrail[Setting up Papertrail]. Use
the Heroku links (Cloud Foundry syslog draining is compatible with Heroku).  Create the
user-provided service and bind it to your existing microservices.

. Open the Papertrail dashboard and view the logs for your application. In Apps Manager, start and stop the bound application and verify that corresponding
log entries are made.

Congratulations, you've used syslog draining to send logs for your application to Papertrail.
