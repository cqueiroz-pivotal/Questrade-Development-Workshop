# Questrade PCF Developers Workshop

## Building Out The .NET Application

*Disclaimer:* We are not a .NET oriented team, as a result this lab is not intended to show best practice for .NET development but rather how a .NET application can be deployed to Pivotal Cloud Foundry and intergrated with other applications.

## Deploying to PCF

```shell
cf push <application name> -s windows2012R2 -b binary_buildpack

Online Console:
